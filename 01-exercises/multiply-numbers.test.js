/*
    Similar to the add-numbers function, 
    write a function that multiplies any
    number of arguments passed to it.
    some expectations:
        multiply(4, 2)  // --> 8
        multiply(2, 2, 3)  // --> 18
    Write your implementation in TDD
        1. Add a Test (see it failing - RED)
        2. Write Code (to make it pass - GREEN)
        3. Refactor if needed
        4. REPEAT
