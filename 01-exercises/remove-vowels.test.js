/**
 * This function is supposed to remove vowels from a phrase
 * Add tests to prove that it functions properly with these examples at least:
 *         removeVowels("goodbye")  // --> "gdby"
 *         removeVowels("nodegirls")  // --> "nd grls"
 *         removeVowels('how are you today?') // --> "hw r y tdy?"
 * Consider EDGE cases (how the function behaves if you pass undefined, or a number etc..)
 * Then add a test that contains CAPITAL vowel letters (hEllo for example)
 *      - It should expect the E to be removed
 *      - Run the tests and see you new test fail (RED)
 *      - Change the implementatino to remove the letter (capital and small letters)
 *       (maybe Google Case Insensitive Regular Expressions and read about regular expressions and see how you can use them)
